# Project Kanban Guide

This project is meant to simulate a basic task management system. The project comprises a few basic apis and some unit tests.

The objective is to make the unit tests pass, they are ordered so the _1 is the first test to solve.

Main goal of this exercise is to see what your problem solving process is like. Feel free to google and  ask any questions.

## Rules
- You can't change the test code.

### Tips
- This is just a unit test project, the application can only be ran/debugged using unit tests not from Standard F5/Run 
- The database tables are defined in ProjectKanban/Data/001.sql
- Can run tests by right clicking the project file on the left and pressing "Run Tests"
- The intention of the tests is documented in the class and method name, read as Given When Then 
- Can navigate files names/types by pressing Ctrl + T
- Can run or debug an individual test by either the unit test pane at the bottom of the IDE or when looking at the source code
  click the test icon next to the line number.
